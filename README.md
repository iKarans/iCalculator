# iCalculator

## Introduction

A calculator desgined using HTML, SCSS, CSS and Javascript.

The functionality of the calculator mimics that which is seen on a simple calculator App. Each input is limited to 15 characters including the automatic commas that will appear. However, I have left the output unlimited so you can continuously perform calculations to your hearts content! The calculator is able to remember your previous input and operand so you can press the equals button again to perform the same operation. If you clicked the wrong operator then fear not as you will be change whenever it whenever you want. There also a light button that toggles light mode for you folks who enjoy that 🤷‍♂️. There's also a hidden easter egg 😏😏😏.

## Testing

## Improvements / To Dos

*The way javascript handles float calculations isn't the best so sometimes the output isn't accurate.
*Add more math operators.
*Need to make del button work after the equal sign has been pressed.
